# Costume-VR-Viewer
- This is my internship project were I used Threejs to build and webgl to build a costume Virtual reality viewr and compare it with the Threejs built in Viewer.
- I collected photos for couple of building to generate a point cloud model then converted it to a mesh in Meshlab.
- Then I built a vr viewer to display them on the browser with a cardbox.
- The costume vr viewer can be seen in the drop down menu in the corner. 
- The models are generated from drone shots for 2 popular buildings in Turkey (Maiden's Tower & Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Camii)

Results can be seen here: https://vr-hosting.firebaseapp.com

models should take 10 seconds to load, and use your smartphone for better results.
